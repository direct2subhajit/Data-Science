### What are Diamonds?
- Diamonds are the Precious stone consisting of a clear and colourless Crystalline form of pure carbon.

- They are the hardest Gemstones known to man and can be scratched only by other Diamonds.

### Why are Diamonds so Valuable?
- Whether it is a Rare book, a fine bottle of Scotch, or a Diamond, something that is Rare and Unique is often expensive.
- But what makes it truly Valuable is that this Rarity coincides with the desire of many to possess it. ;)
- Diamonds are Rare because of the Incredibly powerful forces needed to create them.

And therefore Diamonds are considered to be Very Costly.

This classic dataset contains the prices and other attributes of almost ~ 54,000 diamonds.

Let's do some EDA (Exploratory Data Analysis) on these Diamond Dataset in R Language.

#### Attributes:
- **Price**- price in US dollars (\$326--\$18,823)

- **carat**- weight of the diamond (0.2--5.01)

- **cut**- quality of the cut (Fair, Good, Very Good, Premium, Ideal)

- **color**- diamond colour, from J (worst) to D (best)

- **clarity**- a measurement of how clear the diamond is (I1 (worst), SI2, SI1, VS2, VS1, VVS2, VVS1, IF (best))

- **x**- length in mm (0--10.74)

- **y**- width in mm (0--58.9)

- **z**- depth in mm (0--31.8)

- **depth**- total depth percentage = z / mean(x, y) = 2 * z / (x + y) (43--79)

- **table**- width of top of diamond relative to widest point (43--95)

_Now look at the R notebook for more analysis._
